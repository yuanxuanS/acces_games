# @package _global_

# In this experiment, we make AM have the same number of samples as POMO. 
# In POMO, they ran 100,000 * 510 * 50 (if num_loc=50) = ~2,550,000,000 effective samples (this is the batch size)
# (NOTE: 510 is for TSP20. It looks like they ran a mastodontic 3000+ epochs for TSP100 according to the official implementation)
# For the AM implementation, if we divide by 1,280,000 samples per epoch, this is almost 2000 epochs. In other words, they are using 20x as many samples.
# If we account for 3000+ epochs in TSP100, and 100 for batch augmentation, this means that they had more than 100x more samples than the original AM.
# We can try to see whether training AM for longer makes sense. Let's take TSP50 and batch_size 64 as original = 3200 of batch size.
# Then, let's train for around 500 epochs (total of 4x less samples than POMO) to see what happens
