# Older experiment versions

These experiments are the ones we ran in the first version of our paper. The only difference is that, from version `0.1.0`, we added several new features and made a major refactoring that simplifies our codebase!

We will update the experiments with the refactored versions. To use these, you may use RL4CO no greater than version `0.0.6`:

```bash
pip install rl4co<=0.0.6
```
