RL4CO is now available for installation on `pip`!
```bash
pip install rl4co
```

## Local install and development
If you want to develop RL4CO or access the latest builds, we recommend you to install it locally with `pip` in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co && cd rl4co
pip install -e .
```

> Note: `conda` is also a good candidate for hassle-free installation of PyTorch: check out the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for more details.
